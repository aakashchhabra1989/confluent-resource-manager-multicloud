# AWS Flink (Tableflow) Resources
# This file contains Flink compute pool and SQL statement resources for stream processing

# ============================================================================
# FLINK CONFIGURATION STATUS:
# ============================================================================
# ✅ WORKING: Flink Compute Pool is successfully created and operational
# ❌ BLOCKED: Flink SQL Statement resources are commented out due to 401 Unauthorized error
#
# ISSUE ANALYSIS:
# - The 401 Unauthorized error occurs when trying to create Flink SQL statements
# - This is likely due to one of the following:
#   1. Flink service not fully enabled in this Confluent Cloud environment
#   2. Missing specific Flink permissions that aren't covered by standard roles
#   3. Regional availability limitations for Flink in us-east-1
#   4. Confluent Cloud trial/billing account limitations for Flink features
#   5. Authentication configuration mismatch for Flink SQL operations
#
# INFRASTRUCTURE READY:
# - All Flink SQL files are properly created in AWS/flink/sql/ directory
# - Terraform configuration is syntactically correct and validated
# - Dependencies and resource references are properly configured
# - Once authentication issue is resolved, uncomment the statement resources
#
# NEXT STEPS TO RESOLVE:
# 1. Contact Confluent support to verify Flink service enablement
# 2. Check if trial environment has Flink SQL limitations  
# 3. Verify account billing status for Flink features
# 4. Test with different authentication approaches if needed
